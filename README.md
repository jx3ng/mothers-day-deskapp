# mothers-day-deskapp

A simple and cheeky desktop application created for Mother's Day.
This interactive app is designed to humorously confirm that I am my mother's favorite daughter â€” all in good fun!

## Required Installations:
1. **Node.js** - Download from [nodejs.org](https://nodejs.org)
2. Install Electron as a development dependency:
   ```bash
   npm install electron --save-dev
   ```
3. Electron for packaging and building the app:
   ```bash
   npm install electron-builder --save-dev
   ```

## How the app works:
- The app opens with a mandatory flower for Mother's Day.
- When clicked, it brings the user to a second page where they must make a "choice."
- The objective? Confirm that I am her favorite child

## References:
- All animations were created by me on Procreate.
- The entire idea and concept were also developed by me.
- As this is my first time using Electron, I had assistance from ChatGPT to get started with the basic structure and code.
- I also referenced [this video by VisualTimmy](https://youtu.be/tPQTGC5-_Is?si=EEPzgtlULKLENXUt) on how to make pixel art on Procreate.
